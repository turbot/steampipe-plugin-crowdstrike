# Table: crowdstrike_spotlight_vulnerability - Query CrowdStrike Spotlight Vulnerabilities using SQL

CrowdStrike Spotlight is a vulnerability management module within the CrowdStrike Falcon platform. It continuously identifies vulnerabilities in real-time and provides visibility into the vulnerability exposure of all managed systems. Spotlight combines the speed and scale of CrowdStrikeâ€™s real-time threat data with comprehensive vulnerability management.

## Table Usage Guide

The `crowdstrike_spotlight_vulnerability` table provides insights into vulnerabilities within CrowdStrike Spotlight. As a security analyst, explore vulnerability-specific details through this table, including vulnerability severity, status, and associated metadata. Utilize it to uncover information about vulnerabilities, such as those posing high risk, the systems affected by these vulnerabilities, and prioritization of vulnerability remediation efforts.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore when vulnerabilities were detected and their current status to keep track of security threats and ensure the system remains secure.

```sql
select
  created_timestamp,
  host_info -> 'hostname' AS hostname,
  status
from
  crowdstrike_spotlight_vulnerability;
```

### List all known vulnerabilities
Explore known vulnerabilities within your system to understand their severity and impact. This can help prioritize security measures and respond effectively to potential threats.

```sql
select
  created_timestamp,
  host_info -> 'hostname' AS hostname,
  status,
  app -> 'product_name_version' AS product_name_version,
  cve -> 'exprt_rating' AS exprt_rating,
  cve -> 'id' AS cve_id,
  cve -> 'description' AS cve_description
from
  crowdstrike_spotlight_vulnerability;
```

### List vulnerabilities created in the last 15 days
Discover the recent vulnerabilities by identifying instances where new vulnerabilities have been created in the past 15 days. This helps in maintaining up-to-date security by promptly addressing newly discovered threats.

```sql
select
  created_timestamp,
  host_info -> 'hostname' AS hostname,
  status
from
  crowdstrike_spotlight_vulnerability
where
  created_timestamp > now() - interval '15 days';
```

### List all vulnerabilities with an `exprt` rating of `critical` that were open for more than 24 hours
Determine the areas in which critical vulnerabilities were open for more than 24 hours. This is useful for identifying potential security gaps that may have been exploited during this period.

```sql
select
  created_timestamp,
  host_info -> 'hostname' AS hostname,
  cve,
  status
from
  crowdstrike_spotlight_vulnerability
where
  cve ->> 'exprt_rating' = 'CRITICAL'
  and status = 'closed'
  and created_timestamp - closed_timestamp > interval '24 hours';
```

### List all open vulnerabilities with an `exprt` rating of `critical`
Explore which vulnerabilities are currently open and have been rated as critical. This provides valuable insights into potential threats that need immediate attention for risk mitigation.

```sql
select
  created_timestamp,
  host_info -> 'hostname' AS hostname,
  cve,
  status
from
  crowdstrike_spotlight_vulnerability
where
  cve ->> 'exprt_rating' = 'CRITICAL'
  and status = 'open';
```

### List all open vulnerabilities with an `exprt` rating of `critical` with the email of the host user
Explore open vulnerabilities rated as 'critical' to identify potential security risks and gain insights into the associated host user's email for further action. This query is particularly useful in prioritizing and managing cyber threats.

```sql
select
  created_timestamp,
  host_info -> 'hostname' as hostname,
  cve,
  v.status as vuln_status,
  hosts.email,
  hosts.status as host_status
from
  crowdstrike_spotlight_vulnerability as v
  left join
    crowdstrike_host as hosts
    on host_info ->> 'hostname' = hosts.hostname
where
  cve ->> 'exprt_rating' = 'CRITICAL'
  and v.status = 'open';
```
